####1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

One of five magazines that are a permanent fixture on my bookshelf is the June 2015 double issue of Bloomberg Businessweek – the “Code Issue.”  I remember seeing this on newsstands a few months after I moved from Seattle back to the East Coast.  The cover is twenty lines of code with the caption “If You Can’t Read That, You’d Better Read This” directly underneath.  I picked the magazine up and skipped forward to the introduction in which Josh Tyrangiel states “The world belongs to people who code.”  I bought it.  

That magazine is not what originally interested me in programming – I certainly had an interest before then - but I credit it with re-igniting my interest in learning to code and also with giving me the basic understanding I needed to feel confident that many of the professional skills I have would lend themselves towards my being a successful developer.  As for exposing myself to programming, I taught myself basic CSS following tutorials on PuglyPixel in order to customize my beer and travel blog / passion project [HopHeadsinBeds](www.hopheadsinbeds.com).  I have also taken a handful of 2-3 hour General Assembly basic programming-focused courses in addition to their 12-week UX course.


####2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?

Growing up my mother always told my sisters and I that the jobs we would have as adults didn’t exist yet.  While I am currently actively planning to pivot my professional career path from sales/account management to web development (hence this application for ADA) I believe her statement has a truth to it now more than ever.  Having said that, my professional goals for the next two years include:
-	Employment as a web developer based in Seattle 
-	Participating in TNooz’s travel-themed THack Hackathon
-	Building a professional network within the coding community
-	Establishing my personal brand and professional online presence with a new blog and website

As for the next five years, I’m closely watching advancements in the VR field and would like to potentially pursue a career in WebVR development.  I also know I want to work to make STEM field careers more accessible for other women.  The Bloomberg Businessweek article I mentioned above was so important to me because it made the world of coding feel truly *accessible* for the first time.  Through public speaking engagements and working with programs like ADA I see myself sharing this feeling of accessibility in the next five years.
