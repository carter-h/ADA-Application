####1. Why are you interested in programming? What have you done to expose yourself to programming so far?

One of five magazines that are a permanent fixture on my bookshelf is the June 2015 double issue of Bloomberg Businessweek – the “Code Issue.”  I remember seeing this on newsstands a few months after I moved from Seattle back to the East Coast.  The cover is twenty lines of code with the caption “If You Can’t Read That, You’d Better Read This” directly underneath.  I picked the magazine up and skipped forward to the introduction in which Josh Tyrangiel states “The world belongs to people who code.”  I bought it.  

That magazine is not what originally interested me in programming – I certainly had an interest before then - but I credit it with re-igniting my interest in learning to code and also with giving me the basic understanding I needed to feel confident that many of the professional skills I have would lend themselves towards my being a successful developer.  As for exposing myself to programming, I taught myself basic CSS following tutorials on PuglyPixel in order to customize my beer and travel blog / passion project [HopHeadsinBeds](http://www.hopheadsinbeds.com).  I have also taken a handful of 2-3 hour General Assembly basic programming-focused courses in addition to their 12-week UX course.


####2. What are your professional goals for the next 2 years, the next 5 years?

Growing up my mother always told my sisters and I that the jobs we would have as adults didn’t exist yet.  While I am currently actively planning to pivot my professional career path from sales/account management to web development (hence this application for ADA) I believe her statement has a truth to it now more than ever.  Having said that, my professional goals for the next two years include:
-	Employment as a web developer based in Seattle 
-	Participating in TNooz’s travel-themed THack Hackathon
-	Building a professional network within the coding community
-	Establishing my personal brand and professional online presence with a new blog and website

As for the next five years, I’m closely watching advancements in the VR field and would like to potentially pursue a career in WebVR development.  I also know I want to work to make STEM field careers more accessible for other women.  The [Bloomberg Businessweek article](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/) I mentioned above was so important to me because it made the world of coding feel truly *accessible* for the first time.  Through public speaking engagements and working with programs like ADA I hope to share this feeling of accessibility over the next five years.

####3. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?

One of the biggest lessons I have learned in my career is to not shy away from asking for what you want in your professional life when it comes to responsibilities, future growth opportunities and compensation.  People are not mind readers – they won’t know what you want unless you ask for it.

Specifically regarding compensation, when I applied for my first promotion I made the mistake of not being clear with myself regarding my salary expectations.  When my negotiations began the first salary offer was below my current base as I would be relocating to a new, “cheaper” city with different salary caps.  Ultimately I negotiated a higher base however I did not strongly push to have my tenure and experience accounted for.  I told myself that I was gaining management experience and was ok compromising.  

I accepted the promotion and later learned team members I managed had salaries higher than what the company first offered me as a manager. I regretted not advocating for myself more.  Following the above experience I have had two raise negotiations and always prepare a personal high/medium/low proposal backed by my performance data.  I have become comfortable talking about the worth of my work.

####4. Have you taught yourself anything before? Describe what you learned and how you approached it.

As someone who is naturally curious and who recognizes read/write as their preferred LARK learning style, I am constantly googling questions and acquiring information.  Having said that, learning to knit hats while a camp counselor is a time where I had the specific intention to teach myself a new skill. 

I had zero previous knitting experience. For the first week I practiced casting-on the first row of stitches repeatedly with experienced knitters watching, advising and working on their own projects.  When I began to knit after learning the “around the needle, through the loop and back over the needle” process I was so excited about finishing my first project that I cast off too soon. The final product looked like a red knit Yarmulke due to the stitches being too tight (and too few).  

My next project was a hat using 10 different colored yarns and a pattern based on something I had seen at the Gap.  It took me the whole Summer to complete but I was up for the challenge.  My philosophy when learning something comes down to the following quote: 

> “*Whether you think you can, or you think you can't - you're right.*” – Henry Ford
